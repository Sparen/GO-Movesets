# GO Movesets

In this repository, you will find my compilation of Pokémon GO Moveset data for all final stage Pokémon in-game. 

Originally, this project was entirely closed, as it was a work in progress starting with Generation 2. However, since there is no harm in sharing it publicly, it is now available to the public. 

It is live at [https://sparen.github.io/GO-Movesets](https://sparen.github.io/GO-Movesets).

## Disclaimers

I do not claim the information provided to be accurate in any way, shape, or form. The game can change without warning and since my information is based on the Silph Road, any errors there can and will get propogated here.

The current database, linked above, uses Javascript to load all the necessary information, allowing for easier updating of information in case of another major game overhaul.

If there are any errors, open an issue or send a pull request with the fixed data. After major game overhauls, I will confer with the Silph Road.

## Miscellaneous Notes

* Delibird is currently in the database, although it has not yet been officially released at the time of writing. Smeargle, however, is not.
